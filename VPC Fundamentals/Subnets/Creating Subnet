Subnets
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Public subnets are for resources that must be connected to the internet, and private subnets for resources that won't be exposed to the internet.

In this section we will create two public and two private subnets in each of two availability zones within your VPC.
