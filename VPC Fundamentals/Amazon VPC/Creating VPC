Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

To get started, navigate to the Your VPCs tab  in the VPC section of the console and click Create VPC button.

Create VPC

Select VPC only under Resources to create
Enter VPC A as the Name tag
Specify 10.0.0.0/16 as IPv4 CIDR block.
Do not enable IPv6.
Leave Default selected as Tenancy.
Accept proposed Tags
Click Create VPC
Create VPC A

After completing these steps, you should have a new VPC listed under Your VPCs

Click on Actions and select Edit VPC settings from the dropdown

Check the box to enable DNS hostnames and select Save. Enable DNS hostnames

Congratulations, your first VPC is now built
